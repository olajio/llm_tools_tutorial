    "## Part 1: What is a Tool in LLM Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tool** in LLM engineering is a way to give a language model the ability to perform actions beyond just generating text. Think of it like giving the AI \"hands\" to interact with the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "LLMs can only generate text. They can't check databases, call APIs, or perform calculations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "We define \"tools\" (functions) that the LLM can request to be called. The workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User asks a question (e.g., \"What's the price of a ticket to London?\")\n",
    "2. LLM recognizes it needs external data and says \"I want to call the `get_ticket_price` function with `destination_city='London'`\"\n",
    "3. Your code actually executes that function\n",
    "4. The result is sent back to the LLM\n",
    "5. LLM formulates a natural language response using that data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "- **Tool Definition**: A JSON schema describing the function name, what it does, and its parameters\n",
    "- **Tool Handler**: Code that executes the actual function when the LLM requests it\n",
    "- **Chat Loop**: Logic that detects when the LLM wants to use tools, handles it, and continues the conversation"

    "The original code progressed through these stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Version | Storage | Limitation |\n",
    "|---------|---------|------------|\n",
    "| Initial | Hardcoded dictionary | Prices can't be changed at runtime |\n",
    "| Improved | SQLite database | Prices are persistent and can be updated |\n",
    "| Final | SQLite + Auto-pricing | Unknown cities get prices auto-generated |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Improvements:\n",
    "1. **From dictionary to database**: Prices are stored in SQLite, making them persistent and modifiable\n",
    "2. **Added `set_ticket_price` function**: Allows updating prices programmatically\n",
    "3. **Database uses UPSERT**: The `ON CONFLICT...DO UPDATE` pattern means it inserts new cities or updates existing ones\n",
    "4. **Auto-pricing for unknown cities**: When a city has no price, the system generates one and saves it for future queries"
